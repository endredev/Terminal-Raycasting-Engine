# Terminal Raycasting Engine

I've always been fascinated by those early "3D" game engines. 

I still remember the first time I played Doom, and it felt like the game world was all around me, making it a super immersive experience. 

Even though I've been working as an engineer for a while, I never really understood how these engines worked. So, one weekend, I decided to challenge myself. I read up on it and managed to create a really simple ray casting engine (that's what they're called, I found out!) in the terminal, using only C++ and without relying on any other libraries or engines.
